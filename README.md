## Inspirationüí°
There is no shortage of people in the world who can think in a logical, structured way, but are not necessarily programmers. Text-based coding is not easy. In the new era, where software development is in high demand and programming has become an essential skill. When you look at the programming languages, you will notice that they are designed by engineers, for engineers. . Codeinventor was inspired by a desire to bring more visual tools to market, allowing more people to become programmers without needing to code.

## What it does‚ùì
codeinventer is a no code based programming tool which make block coding and use it for hardware as well as software programming for hardware we have only arduino based and for software we have javascript python and php language generators.we can save our projects too. and retrieve them when we needed .Codeinventor makes made programming easier for students and people who don't know programming.
- Provide robust user authentication.
- Creating and Managing Projects.
- Block based programming for text-based programming languages like PHP, Python and
- JavaScript.
- Also Block based programming for Arduino
- Can make software projects as well as hardware projects with codeinventor

## How we built itüôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª
- Codeinventor is built using Reactjs for the front end and Appwrite for the back end. We integrate with Appwrite for authentication and single sign on allowing for seamless integration with Teams. 
- we have used python and php technologies.

## Challenges we ran intoüéñÔ∏è
- It was the first time we were using Appwrite to it makes difficult as we need to see every small thing before implementing

## Accomplishments that we're proud ofüìù
- we are proud of successfully completing the project in the deadline using new tools and technologies like Appwrite and ocaml. Block-based programming is the best solution to the below problem. Thus, we believe that our idea is authentic.
- Combining our creativity and research abilities to build a beautiful web application.
- We also learned how to work remotely. We learned how to use new tools for remote work, like VS Code's Live Share features, ngrok for localhost port forwarding, GitHub for collaboration, and how to integrate APIs with the software.
## What we learned
- Reading the detailed documentation from Appwrite https://appwrite.io/docs was very helpful.

## What's next for CodeInventor
- From here we'll be adding more visuals, a data frame based SQL Query builder, and a data frame based ETL tool similar to Power BI Data Flows and/or Power Query.
